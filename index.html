    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is <span style="background-color: yellow">Alex</span>(Awat) Habibi. <img src="me.jpg" width="150" height="250" alt="Photo of me"> </p>
      <p>Currently, I'm a senior relationship manager, which is a fancy way of saying banker. I was in college when I got the possition, so I had to drop out of PSU my sophmore year. <span class="s-pan1">I decided to take the Epicodus course because I find the field interesting and wanted to learn new skills</span>. My ultimate goal is to travel to third world countries and help those in need by teaching them English and maybe coding basics. I also want to set up a way for people to directly donate to less fortunate, rather than go through a company that might keep the majority of the money, and figures it wouldn't hurt to learn this skill set.</p>
      <p>In my spare time outside of work and my studies, I like to draw with charcoal or paint with spray paint. I also dabble in a little bit of clothing desgin. However my favorite hobby is <strong>Gardening</strong>. Gardening has been such a large part of my life that I wouldn't feel right without a garden in the summer. I like to grow flowers, fruits, and veggies. Growing fruits and veggies is fun and nice beacuse I can eat them, they reduce my carbon footprint, and its healthier, my heart belongs to the flowers. From as young as I can remember I was working with flowers one way or another. At the age of five I started making bouqets that my mother and I would sell to grocery stores. What ever the stores didn't buy we'd sell on the side of the road out of our van. When ever I feel overwhelmed or lost in the world I would just go to my garden and put my mind at easy. Theres always more to do, especially durring harvest season. As for the fruits and viggies; I am currently growing </p>
